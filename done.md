# What has been done

## CDOM spectra

The CDOM spectra were modeled according to the information in Babin 2003.

-   acdom spectra were re-fitted using the complete data (i.e. wavelength between at 350 nm instead of 380 nm).

```
-   Between 350-500 nm.

-   Average background values calculated between 683-687 nm.

-   Some files were in binary format, so I could not open them (e.: `C2001000.YSA`).

-   Some spectra start at 300 nm while others at 350 nm.

-   There are clear problems with the spectra of the C6 cruise.

-   Calculate the correlation between the measured and the fitted values as an indicator to remove bad fits.

-   Export the complete spectra (350-700): both the raw and the modeled data.

## Phytoplankton and non-algal absorption

-   Original data had background averaged calculated between 745 and 750 nm. A new background value has been calculated between 746 and 750 nm.

## Other stuff

-   Extract table In Massimo 2000.
