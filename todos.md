-   There are two stations without geographical coordinates:

    -   C2001000
    -   C2002000

-   Find a good way to flag data:

    -   For example, all `a_phy`, `a_nap`, `a_tot` spectra contain negative absorption values, but this does not mean they are bad spectra.

-   There are a lot of nutrient parameters that have values of zero. Are they true zero or indicate missing values?

-   Orientation of the paper

    -   The data is a mix of temporal and spatial observations, so how should we present the data?

        -   By `area`?

-   Irradiance data:

    -   eu means eu0- that was estimated

    -   ed is ed0- calculated from 0.96\*ed0+
