-   There are two stations without geographical coordinates:

    -   C2001000
    -   C2002000

-   Find a good way to flag data:

    -   For example, all `a_phy`, `a_nap`, `a_tot` spectra contain negative absorption values, but this does not mean they are bad spectra.

-   Orientation of the paper

    -   The data is a mix of temporal and spatial observations, so how should we present the data?
