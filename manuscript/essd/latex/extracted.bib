  abstract =      {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of
                   the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater
                   ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and
                   reservoirs) have rarely been considered as
                   potentially important quantitative components of the
                   carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By
                   taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment
                   accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of
                   aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the
                   role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon
                   cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that
                   inland waters annually receive, from a combination of
                   background and anthropogenically altered sources, on
                   the order of 1.9 Pg C y(-1) from the terrestrial
                   landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic
                   sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is
                   returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the
                   remaining 0.9 Pg y(-1) is delivered to the oceans,
                   roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon.
                   Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic
                   systems from land as is exported from land to the
                   sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic
                   systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much
                   of the surrounding land. Although their area is
                   small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect
                   regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of
                   inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight
                   about the storage, oxidation and transport of
                   terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the

                   organic particles can represent an important fraction
                   of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool in aquatic
                   ecosystems and their optical properties differ from
                   those normally considered dissolved ( {$<$} . 0.2.
                   {$\mu$}m), which means that the choice of filter
                   type/pore size can influence the light absorption
                   characteristics. In this study, a total of 867 paired
                   CDOM absorption spectra (n = 1734) from different
                   ecosystems (lakes, streams, sewages and estuaries)
                   were measured on 0.2. {$\mu$}m and GF/F (nominal pore
                   size 0.7. {$\mu$}m) filters. The aims were to
                   evaluate how fine organic particles influence the
                   spectral signature of the DOM pool and to quantify
                   the effects of choice of filter type. In aquatic
                   ecosystems influenced by terrestrial DOM (rivers and
                   lakes), the dissolved fraction (here defined as {$<$}
                   . 0.2. {$\mu$}m) overwhelmed the fine particulate
                   signal (0.2-0.7. {$\mu$}m) which did not contribute
                   significantly to the absorption signal. In contrast,
                   freshly-produced fine particles released by
                   phytoplankton significantly increased measured CDOM
                   absorption in productive environments with low
                   terrestrial background. Our results demonstrate that
                   the choice of filter pore size can have a significant
                   impact on the outcome of spectral metrics often used
                   to characterise CDOM such as the spectral slope (S)
                   or the slope ratio (SR). Hence, this may complicate
                   the combining of CDOM absorption measurements from
                   different studies where different pore sizes were
                   used as fine particulate material may significantly
                   influence the spectral signature, particularly in
                   situations where phytoplankton is the dominating
                   source of DOM.},

                   in various coastal waters around Europe including the
                   English Channel, Adriatic Sea, Baltic Sea,
                   Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea. For comparison, we
                   also collected data in the open ocean waters of North
                   Atlantic. The exponential slope of the CDOM
                   absorption spectrum varied within a narrow range
                   around 0.0176 nm-1 (SD = 0.0020 nm-1). When data from
                   all the regions were considered altogether, the
                   relationship between phytoplankton absorption and
                   chlorophyll concentration was generally similar to
                   the one previously established for open oceanic
                   waters. Our coastal data, however, show that
                   significant departures from the general trend may
                   occur due to peculiar pigment composition and cell
                   size. In some coastal areas, high phaeopigment
                   concentrations gave rise to especially high
                   blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton absorption. The
                   NAP absorption covaried with the particle dry weight.
                   Most absorption spectra of these particles were well
                   described by an exponential function with a slope
                   averaging 0.0123 nm-1 (SD = 0.0013 nm-1). In some
                   highly turbid waters, the spectra exhibited a
                   signature possibly associated with iron oxides. In
                   the Baltic Sea, NAP absorption systematically showed
                   lower values at wavelengths shorter than 440 nm than
                   predicted from the fitted exponential function.
                   Overall, the variability in the absorption properties
                   of European coastal waters showed some consistent
                   patterns despite the high diversity of the examined
                   waters. Distinct features were identified in the
                   phytoplankton and NAP components. An absorption
                   budget is presented and parameterizations are
                   proposed.},

                   Outside of Polar regions, the Regional Centers
                   provide their data sets as sparse grids i.e. only
                   grid cells that contain data are populated. These
                   data sets were included on to the base grid without
                   any blending. The data sets supplied in the form of
                   complete grids (primarily areas north of 60N and
                   south of 50S) were included using feather blending
                   techniques from GlobalMapper software. The
                   GEBCO\_2021 Grid has been developed through the
                   Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. This is
                   a collaborative project between the Nippon Foundation
                   of Japan and the General Bathymetric Chart of the
                   Oceans (GEBCO). It aims to bring together all
                   available bathymetric data to produce the definitive
                   map of the world ocean floor by 2030 and make it
                   available to all. Funded by the Nippon Foundation,
                   the four Seabed 2030 Regional Centers include the

                   respect to pigment and particle content. The use of
                   110-cm cells and then of 10-cm cells, with a highly
                   sensitive spectrophotometer, allowed measurement
                   throughout the UV-visible range (200-700 nm) even for
                   the low concentrations of yellow substance
                   encountered in the open sea. The concentration
                   appears influenced predominantly by natural and
                   industrial land discharges. In oceanic waters, it
                   remains low and seems to be related to the biological

                   substance in the open sea may have an effect on

                   of low or moderate algal biomass. The spectral
                   dependence law of absorption appears to vary within a
                   restricted range, and an average law can be

                   estimating the surface concentration of particulate
                   organic carbon, POC, from optical measurements of
                   spectral remote-sensing reflectance,
                   Rrs({$\lambda$}), using field data collected in
                   tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern South
                   Pacific and eastern Atlantic Oceans. These approaches
                   include a direct empirical relationship between POC
                   and the blue-to-green band ratio of reflectance,
                   Rrs({$\lambda$}B)/Rrs(555), and two-step algorithms
                   that consist of relationships linking reflectance to
                   an inherent optical property IOP (beam attenuation or
                   backscattering coefficient) and POC to the IOP. We
                   considered two-step empirical algorithms that
                   exclusively include pairs of empirical relationships
                   and two-step hybrid algorithms that consist of
                   semianalytical models and empirical relationships.
                   The surface POC in our data set ranges from about 10
                   mg m-3 within the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre to
                   270 mg m-3 in the Chilean upwelling area, and
                   ancillary data suggest a considerable variation in
                   the characteristics of particulate assemblages in the
                   investigated waters. The POC algorithm based on the
                   direct relationship between POC and
                   Rrs({$\lambda$}B)/Rrs(555) promises reasonably good
                   performance in the vast areas of the open ocean
                   covering different provinces from hyperoligotrophic
                   and oligotrophic waters within subtropical gyres to
                   eutrophic coastal upwelling regimes characteristic of
                   eastern ocean boundaries. The best error statistics
                   were found for power function fits to the data of POC
                   vs. Rrs(443)/Rrs(555) and POC vs. Rrs(490)/Rrs(555).
                   For our data set that includes over 50 data pairs,
                   these relationships are characterized by the mean
                   normalized bias of about 2\% and the normalized root
                   mean square error of about 20\%. We recommend that
                   these algorithms be implemented for routine
                   processing of ocean color satellite data to produce
                   maps of surface POC with the status of an evaluation
                   data product for continued work on algorithm
                   development and refinements. The two-step algorithms
                   also deserve further attention because they can
                   utilize various models for estimating IOPs from
                   reflectance, offer advantages for developing an
                   understanding of bio-optical variability underlying
                   the algorithms, and provide flexibility for regional
                   or seasonal parameterizations of the algorithms.},

  abstract =      {Most of the carbon fixed in primary production is
                   rapidly cycled and remin-eralized, leaving behind
                   various forms of organic carbon that contribute to a
                   vast reservoir of nonliving organic matter in
                   seawater. Most of this carbon resides in dissolved
                   molecules of varying bioavailability and reactivity,
                   and aspects of the cycling of this carbon remain an
                   enigma. The size-reactivity continuum model provides
                   a conceptual framework for understanding the
                   mechanisms governing the formation and mineralization
                   of this carbon. In the seawater bioassay experiments
                   that served as the original basis for this model,
                   investigators observed that larger size classes of
                   organic matter were more bioavailable and more
                   rapidly remineralized by microbes than were smaller
                   size classes. Studies of the chemical composition and
                   radiocarbon content of marine organic matter have
                   further indicated that the complexity and age of
                   organic matter increase with decreasing molecular
                   size. Biodegra-dation processes appear to shape the
                   size distribution of organic matter and the nature of
                   the small dissolved molecules that persist in the
                   ocean.},

                   Color (COASTlOOC) oceanographic expeditions were
                   conducted in 1997 and 1998 to examine the
                   relationship between the optical properties of
                   seawater and related biological and chemical
                   properties across the coastal-to-open ocean gradient
                   along the European coasts. A total of 379 stations
                   were visited along the coasts of the Gulf of Lion in
                   the Mediterranean Sea (n = 61), Adriatic Sea (n =
                   39), Baltic Sea (n = 57), North Sea (n = 99), English
                   Channel (n = 85) and Atlantic Ocean (n = 38). A
                   particular emphasis has been dedicated to the
                   collection of a comprehensive set of apparent (AOPs)
                   and inherent (IOPs) optical properties to support the
                   development of ocean color remote sensing algorithms.
                   The data were collected in situ using traditional
                   ship-based sampling, but also from a helicopter,
                   which is a very efficient means for that type of
                   coastal sampling. The dataset collected during the
                   COASTlOOC campaigns is still today quite unique in
                   that it is fully consistent in terms of operators,
                   protocols, and instrumentation. This rich and
                   historical dataset is still today frequently
                   requested and used by other researchers. Therefore,
                   we present the result of an effort to compile and
                   standardize a dataset which will facilitate their
                   reuse in future development and evaluation of new
                   bio-optical models adapted for optically-complex
                   waters.},
