\begin{abstract}
    Coastal Surveillance Through Observation of Ocean Color (COASTLOOC) oceanographic expeditions were conducted in 1997 and 1998 to obtain a synoptic view of the spatial distribution of different biological, chemical and physical variables across the land-to-sea gradient along the European coasts. A total of 379 stations distributed in six areas were visited: (1) 39 in the Adriatic Sea, (2) 38 in the Atlantic Ocean, (3) 57 in the Baltic Sea, (4) 85 in the English Channel, (5) 61 in the Mediterranean Sea and (6) 99 in the North Sea. A particular emphasis has been dedicated to the collection of a comprehensive set of apparent (AOPs) and inherent (IOPs) optical properties to document carbon fluxes at both the local and global scales. These radiometric quantities have been measured using traditional ship-based sampling, but also from a helicopter in shallow estuaries, which are more difficult to access from boats. Although that the COASTLOOC campaigns were carried out more than 20 years ago, the rich and historical dataset that has been collected has great potential to contribute to the development and evaluation of new bio-optical models adapted for optically-complex waters. Given that this unique dataset is still today frequently requested by other researchers, we present the result of an effort to compile and standardize data that will facilitate their reuse in other oceanographic studies. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.17882/75345 (Massicotte2022).

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

Since the launch of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) by NASA in 1978, ocean color remote sensing has been used to monitor the state and the evolution of global marine ecosystems both in time and space. In open oceans, the main component that affects the variations in the inherent (IOPs) and apparent (AOPs) optical properties of seawater is phytoplankton, which is usually represented by the concentration of chlorophyll-a (\citep{Morel1977}). Many simple empirical spectral band ratio algorithms have been developed to link changes in remotely-sensed ocean color (OC), measured as reflectance, to the variations in chlorophyll-a concentration (see OReilly2019 for an extensive evaluation of OC band ratio algorithms). Because these algorithms perform surprisingly well, a plethora of studies have been conducted, notably about phytoplankton phenology (e.g., \citealt{Vargas2009}) and phytoplankton primary production (see \citealt{Carr2006} and references therein).

\section{Study area and sampling overview}
TEXT


\subsection{Study area and general sampling strategys}

During the COASTLOOC campaigns, a total of 420 locations were visited. These locations were spread out along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea (\textit{n} = 41 in case 1 water, \textit{n} = 61 in case 2 water), Adriatic Sea (n = 39), Baltic Sea (n = 57), North Sea (n = 99), English Channel (n = 85) and Atlantic Ocean (n = 38) Within each area, the stations were generally distributed along across-shore or along-shore transects to capture the land-to-sea gradients and document river plumes (Fig. 1B). Stations were sampled either with a helicopter or a ship between 1997-04-02 and 1998-09-25 (Fig. 2A). Compared to traditional ship-based sampling, the helicopter platform allowed to efficiently sample shallow estuaries, which can be difficult to access by boat (some samples were collected in waters as shallow as 1 m, \citealt{Babin2003}). Combining both ship and airborne sampling approaches allowed covering the whole inshore to open-ocean aquatic continuum. The bathymetry \citep{GEBCO2020} varied greatly across the stations, where it averaged 10 meters in the Adriatic Sea and 2 600 meters in the Case 1 Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 2B).
