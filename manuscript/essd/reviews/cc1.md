- This manuscript describes the well known and widely used dataset collected by the COASTLOOC project. It is in general well described, but further polish is necessary. Specifically,
- A few citations not available, such as line 30, “Sat, 2000”.
- Font size of many figures (e.g., Fig. 2) should be larger.
- Incomplete sentences (e.g., line 54, “… boat (some samples were collected in waters 55 as shallow as 1 m, Babin 2003”).
- Line 119, R(0+), a typo. Also, please check the grammar of this sentence and the entire manuscript.
- Line 121, “using a sum of two exponential functions to account for Raman scattering”. Need more information on why “two exponential functions”. On the other hand, from the figures in A1, it appears after ~1 m, the Eu(779) is no longer valid.
- Further, for Eu data, did you carry out correction of instrument self shading?
- The increase of Eu(683,706) with depth showing in Fig. 3 suggests this measurement is quite questionable.
- Suggest to include a section to specifically to talk about uncertainties associated with the measured parameters.
- Fig. 7, for Y axis, suggest to use dynamic range, so the R spectra can be presented more clearly.
